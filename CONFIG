# Which table should be used to find the correct queries
# The table is concatanted with '_' and the type of algorithm we
# are running, so for example we have ngrams and dm soundex,
# so t_segments, or query_logs_correct_dm_soundex.  This concat
# is done within the program, and should not be defined here.
# ex: tables = t, o, m, p, new_queries
#correct_tables = query_logs_correct
correct_tables = census_surnames


# Which table should be used to find the mispelled queries
# Really only used when tests = LOGS
#mispelled_tables = query_logs_mispelled
