NAME
    CHANGES Changelog for the Ngram Statistics Package (Text-NSP)

SYNOPSIS
    Revision history for Perl module Text::NSP

DESCRIPTION
    1.09
    Released March 26, 2008 all changes by TDP

    *   Spell checked the modules

    *   Relaxed test caes 27, 29 for ll, 20 for x2, and 13 for phi, due to
        arithemetic differences on 64 bit architectures

    *   Modified Makefile.PL to go back to more standard methods of testing
        and installation.

    *   Modified structure of /t directory for 'make test'. It appears that
        the use of subdirectories in /t with test cases might have been
        causing problems for Windows testing, so we have moved all test
        files to the top level of /t, and also removed the TEST program so
        that things are called in a more standard or generic fashion.

    1.07
    Released March 24, 2008 all changes by TDP

    *   Updated Makefile.PL to no longer require 5.8.5 - have dropped back
        to 5.6

    *   Updated FAQ with some explanation of ALL-TESTS.sh

    *   Renamed /docs as /doc to be consistent with other packages

    *   Added descriptive labels in POD in NAME field of .pl programs to
        provide that info on CPAN display

    *   Fixed duplicate Copyright message bug in documentation of
        Measures.pm

    *   Removed "help" messages from Makefile.PL execution so as to
        (hopefully) avoid problems with installations on Windows.

    *   Corrected error in INSTALL instructions - csh ./ALL-TESTS.sh must be
        performed after 'make install'

    1.05
    Released March 20, 2008 all changes by TDP

    *   Fixed problem with file Testing/statistic/t2 would appear
        (mysteriously) but not be in the MANIFEST. This file was left behind
        during /Testing/statistic/normal-op.sh and is now being removed.

    *   Fixed problem in /Testing where .sh files are sometimes not
        executable. Those files are now invoked via 'csh test.sh' rather
        than './test.sh', meaning that they no longer need to be executable.

    *   Fixed ticket number 24061 from rt.cpan.org regarding incorrection
        version information coming from Measures.pm

    *   Archived all old ChangeLogs to doc/ChangeLogs directory. Began to
        use pod in CHANGES directory instead

    *   Added doc/update-pod.sh to automatically refresh top level read only
        documentation including README, CHANGES, TODO and INSTALL

    *   Fixed Makefile.PL to avoid problems during Windows install. This
        problem and fix was reported by Richard Churchill to the ngram
        mailing list. This may also address ticket #20371 from rt.cpan.org.

    *   Modified Makefile.PL to allow for use of 'make dist' and also
        creation of META.yml
