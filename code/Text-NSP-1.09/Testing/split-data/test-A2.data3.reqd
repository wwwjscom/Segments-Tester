Bosnian Serbs smarting under recent battlefield gains by their Muslim and Croat enemies responded Friday by investing their leader, Radovan Karadzic, with near-dictatorial powers to wage war.
Karadzic had pushed for more power in the wake of gains by mostly Muslim government forces in recent weeks, sometimes supported by Bosnian Croat militias, that forced back the Serbs for hundreds of square miles (square kilometers) on several fronts. Government troops claimed further gains Thursday, saying they moved closer to Serb-held Teslic and Doboj in northern Bosnia. There was no confirmation from Bosnian Serb military sources. They said their troops had stopped a government offensive on Brcko, on the corridor linking rebel Serb holdings in Croatia to Bosnian Serb areas and Serbia proper. And they boasted of having government troops on the run near Bihac, in northwestern Bosnia.
The Bihac region has been hotly fought over in recent days. The United Nations on Thursday condemned rebel Serbs in neighboring Croatia of shelling Bosnian troops across the border and of launching an air attack on Bihac. Fourteen people were wounded when a war plane fired a missile at the town Wednesday. It was unclear whether the aircraft had crossed into Bosnian airspace, thus violating a U.N.-proclaimed no fly zone that could have provoked a NATO attack on the plane.
