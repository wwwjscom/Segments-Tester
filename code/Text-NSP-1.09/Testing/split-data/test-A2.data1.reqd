An endowed chair has been named at a Northern Ireland university program for Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill, the late Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.
``The American Ireland Fund is proud to establish this honorable and prestigious post in memory of Tip O'Neill for his spirited dedication to resolving the differences in Northern Ireland without violence,'' Kingsley Aikins, executive director of the American Ireland Fund, said Thursday.
The program, run jointly by the United Nations University and the University of Ulster, is aimed at developing non-violent approaches to resolve ethnic conflicts. It also focuses on cultivating scholastic, economic and political links between the United States and Ireland.
